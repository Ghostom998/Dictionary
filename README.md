Dictionary

A simple dictionary program written in Python with a graphical user interface and also the abillity to take command line arguements.

The GUI can be loaded simply with the command "python DictionaryGUI.py"

For those comfortable with the command line it may be considered quicker to pass a word as a command line arguement. The definition will then be printed to the terminal.

The command for this is: "python DictionaryGUI.py bridge", using the word bridge as an example.

TODO:
- In Windows: create a shortcut that passes the default GUI command to allow the program to be          opened by simply double clicking an icon which is more user friendly.
- Allow the user to add a permanent entry to the dictionary which updates the JSON file.
- Fix the scrollbar.
